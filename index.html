<h3 id="markdown">How does it Work?</h3>

<p>The abacus is a simple calculation tool that primarily works on the basis of addition and subtraction. Multiplication and division can be done, but involve the same concept as adding and subtracting.</p>

<h3 id="jekyll-themes">Who uses it?</h3>

<p>While calculators are more practical than abacus', it is still used today. There are regional and national competitions for using the abacus in eastern countries, as well as being used for the same function as a calculator in stores. One of the more relevant uses is it's application with those who are blind. As they have no vision, the abacus allows the user to feel the beads and know which number they are calculating. </p>

<h3 id="support-or-contact">Who created it and when was it used?</h3>

<p>The abacus saw most of use before the invention of the calculator, obviously. However, it's specific period of use vareies from each geographic location. It's predicted that the Babylonians were the first to use the abacus as early as 2400 B.C.E. However, other countries have improved upon the design of the abacus over time.</p>
