<h3 id="markdown">How does it Work?</h3>

<p>The abacus is a simple calculation tool that primarily works with addition and subtraction. Multiplication and division can be done, but you must individually multiply/divide each digit in your head and then represent it on the abacus. More complicated calculations can be done using other advanced and non-tradional methods.</p>
<p>There are different types of abacus', however, we will be using the Japanese version. There are a total of 5 rows of beads, and an indefinite number of columns. Each coloumn is a number place. Each row represents the value of the digit. The first row, which is separate from the rest, represent a value of 5. The other 4 rows under it represent a value of 1. Moving these beads towards the center determines the coloumn's value.</p>

<h3 id="jekyll-themes">Who uses it?</h3>

<p>While calculators are more practical than abacus', it is still used today. There are regional and national competitions for using the abacus in eastern countries, as well as being used for the same function as a calculator in some stores. One of the more relevant uses is it's application with those who are blind. As they have no vision, the abacus allows the user to feel the beads and know which number they are calculating.</p>

<h3 id="support-or-contact">Who created it and when was it used?</h3>

<p>The abacus saw most of use before the invention of the calculator, obviously. However, it's specific period of use varies from each geographic location. It's predicted that the Babylonians were the first to use the abacus as early as 2400 B.C.E. using sand and rocks. However, other countries have improved upon the design of the abacus over time.</p>
